            <p>A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and
                Connors
                116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance,
                in
                some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.
